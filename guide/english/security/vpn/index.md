VPN is a Virtual Private Network that allows a user to connect to a private network over the Internet securely and privately. VPN creates an encrypted connection, known as VPN tunnel, and all Internet traffic and communication is passed through this secure tunnel. Thus, keeping the user data secure and private.

There are two basic VPN types which are explained below.

1. Remote Access VPN
Remote access VPN allows a user to connect to a private network and access its services and resources remotely. The connection between the user and the private network happens through the Internet and the connection is secure and private.

Remote Access VPN is useful for business users as well as home users.

A corporate employee, while traveling, uses a VPN to connect to his/her company’s private network and remotely access files and resources on the private network.

Home users, or private users of VPN, primarily use VPN services to bypass regional restrictions on the Internet and access blocked websites. Users conscious of Internet security also use VPN services to enhance their Internet security and privacy.

2. Site – to – Site VPN
A Site-to-Site VPN is also called as Router-to-Router VPN and is mostly used in the corporates. Companies, with offices in different geographical locations, use Site-to-site VPN to connect the network of one office location to the network at another office location. When multiple offices of the same company are connected using Site-to-Site VPN type, it is called as Intranet based VPN. When companies use Site-to-site VPN type to connect to the office of another company, it is called as Extranet based VPN. Basically, Site-to-site VPN create a virtual bridge between the networks at geographically distant offices and connect them through the Internet and maintain a secure and private communication between the networks.

Since Site-to-site VPN is based on Router-to-Router communication, in this VPN type one router acts as a VPN Client and another router as a VPN Server. The communication between the two routers starts only after an authentication is validated between the two.
