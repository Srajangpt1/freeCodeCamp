NMAP
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source security scanner, originally written by Gordon Lyon (also known by his pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich),[2] used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus building a "map" of the network. To accomplish its goal, Nmap sends specially crafted packets to the target host(s) and then analyzes the responses.

The software provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating-system detection. These features are extensible by scripts that provide more advanced service detection,[3] vulnerability detection,[3] and other features. Nmap can adapt to network conditions including latency and congestion during a scan.
